\section {An Introduction to the Theory of Lists \cite{bird1987introduction}}
Formal definitions for lists and list operations. Discusses common list
operations (map, filter, reduce, etc.) and offers best use cases. Provides
examples of multiple interacting operations and operation equivalences.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \question{What are infinite lists?}
\end{itemize}

\section {Functional Pearl: The Zipper \cite{huet1997zipper}}
Describes a data structure that is akin to a zipper, for use in situations in
which trees need to be modified non-destructively. Handles can be on particular
elements of the tree, where locations hold the downward current subtree and the
upward path. Functions are given for navigation left, right, up, and down,
retrieving the nth element, changing an element in place, inserting elements
left, right, and up, and deleting elements. A memoization approach is suggested,
where "scars" hold tree structure for frequently visited elements.

    \item Scala implementation at \href{https://github.com/stanch/zipper}{https://github.com/stanch/zipper}.
    \item \question{Binary trees are shown, but binary tree example doesn't
    allow for any data stored in the tree?}
\end{itemize}
