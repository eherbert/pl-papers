    \\ Presents "Calculation View" (CV), a novel alternate view in Microsoft Excel. Allows users to edit spreadsheets in a more high-level way. Introduces ranges, named ranges, pseudocells, and a block detection algorithm. Details further work to expand CV view, including text interface and expanded features.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \question{Can CV store intermediate values that the user might not need represented on the sheet?}
      \item \question{Can CV be used on its own? Is there a use case for CV being used on its own?}
    \end{itemize}}
