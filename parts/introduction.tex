\chapter {Introduction}

Accumulation of summaries and notes from various PL papers.
This is endeavor is mostly for my own personal use, but I figured eh, open science is a good thing.
So, a lot of what's written here may just be half-formed ideas, or notes that really only make sense to me.

Entry format is (sometimes) as follows.

\begin{description}
  \item[Title of Paper] {[citation].
    \\ Description of contents.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Side note.
      \item \question{Clarifying question?}
    \end{itemize}}
\end{description}
