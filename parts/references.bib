  abstract = {Sheet-defined functions (SDFs) bring modularity and abstraction to the world of spreadsheets. Alas, users naturally write SDFs that work over fixed-size arrays, which limits their re-usability.Â  We describe a principled approach to generalising such functions to become elastic SDFs that work over inputs of arbitrary size, including a principal-generalisation theorem and empirical evaluation through a user study.},
